# DOM Factory üõ†Ô∏è

This project demonstrates how to parse and display static JSON data representing a car factory and its cars directly in the DOM using JavaScript. The data is hard-coded as JSON strings within the script and rendered as HTML elements.

## Assignment üìù

> - Write your cars and factory objects as JSON strings in a variable
> - Parse them with JSON.parse();
> - Write each of them to the DOM in a list
>   - You should use a styled CSS <ul><li> list with no bullets
>   - Don‚Äôt use <table>

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

Open the [index.html](./index.html) file in your browser.  
The script will automatically display the factory and its cars in the designated section of the page.

## Data Structure üì¶

### Cars

Each car object contains:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `make`: Manufacturer
- `model`: Model name
- `year`: Year of production
- `isElectric`: Boolean indicating if the car is electric
- `features`: Array of feature strings
- `registration`: Object with plate, state, and expiry
- `previousOwner`: Object with name and transfer date, or `null`

### Factory

The factory object contains:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Factory name
- `location`: City and state
- `established`: Year of establishment
- `isOperational`: Boolean
- `manager`: Object with name and years of experience
- `lastInspection`: Date or `null`
- `carIds`: Array of car IDs produced by the factory

## Example Output üì§

- **Cars List:**  
  All cars are displayed as a simple list with their make, model, and year.

- **Factory Info:**  
  The factory is shown with its name, location, and year of establishment.
