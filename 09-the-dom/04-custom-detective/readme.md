# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Custom DOM Detective 

For this task, I explored the DOM structure of [HDblog.it](https://www.hdblog.it), a technology news website, using browser developer tools and JavaScript in the console. The goal was to find at least 10 different elements or groups of elements using a variety of selectors.

Below are the queries used and the elements they target.

Finds the anchor tag inside the 9th `<article>` under the `#news_page2` container. Useful for identifying a specific article.

---

### 8. Slideshow container inside a simple slider
