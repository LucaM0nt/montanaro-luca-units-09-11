# Enhanced Word Guesser üéÆ

This project implements the Enhanced Word Guesser game. Players guess letters to reveal a hidden word, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed. The game includes a dynamic UI with buttons for each letter, a reset button, and real-time feedback on the player's progress.

## Assignment üìù

> - Begin with the 'Word Guesser' exercise from a previous lesson
> - Incorporate the following enhancements
>   - Implement an interface to allow users to input letters via an HTML `<input>` element
>       - Integrate additional necessary HTML elements
>       - Validate user input to ensure it consists of a single character and is of the correct type
>   - Enhance the visual presentation of game results directly on the page
>       - This can include the utilization of images or other graphics to enrich the experience
>       - Display previous guesses, the remaining number of guesses, and other pertinent
information to the user
>   - Add additional features that would augment the game's appeal and interactivity

- `gameInitializer()`: Resets the game state and initializes a new game.
- `gameOver()`: Ends the game by disabling all input buttons.
- `createInput(letter)`: Creates an input button for a specific letter.
- `createRow(letters)`: Creates a row of input buttons for a given array of letters.
